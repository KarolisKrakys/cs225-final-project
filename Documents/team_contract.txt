# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
We will have official team meetings every Saturday for an hour in the day. We plan to meet in person. Shikhar will take notes on the things we discuss during the team meeting.
2. **Assistance** 
We all have each others contact information through social media and each others numbers. We are also all on a discord group where we share links and communicate through. We plan on responding to eachother within an hour.
3. **Respect** 
We will make sure that everyone has a voice within our group by actively listening to eachother in group meetings. When we meet, we will solely work on this project and won't get distracted by class, friends, etc. If we have conflicting ideas about a solution, we will make a pros and cons list. If we are still stuck, we will consult with our mentor for advice on the best solution to pursue.
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
Whenever we have task, we will estimate how long it will take to accomplish said task. We will keep a time log that tracks how much each of us are working and we will try to balance out how much time each group member is working in a given week.
5. **Time Commitment** 
Each group member will plan on working 4-6 hours per week on the project. If some members are more busy throughout the week, we each plan on carving out more time out of our Saturdays to work on the project.
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
If someone isn't fulfilling their responsibilities in regards to showing up to meetings and overall contributions to the project, we will confront that person to find out why they aren't meeting their responsibilities. After finding out, as a team, we can figure out a solution. If we cannot come up with a solution or the team member isn't cooperating, we will reach out to our mentor and then course staff if needed.
